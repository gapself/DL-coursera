###**1. What does the analogy “AI is the new electricity” refer to?**
- AI is powering personal devices in our homes and offices, similar to electricity.
- Through the “smart grid”, AI is delivering a new wave of electricity.
- <span style="color:#99e9fa"><b>Similar to electricity starting about 100 years ago, AI is transforming multiple industries.</span></b>
- AI runs on computers and is thus powered by electricity, but it is letting computers do things not possible before.

###**2. Which of these are reasons for Deep Learning recently taking off? (Check the three options that apply.)**
- Neural Networks are a brand new field. 
- <span style="color:#99e9fa"><b> We have access to a lot more data. </span></b>
- <span style="color:#99e9fa"><b> We have access to a lot more computational power. </span></b> 
- <span style="color:#99e9fa"><b> Deep learning has resulted in significant improvements in important applications such as online advertising, speech recognition, and image recognition. </span></b>

###**3. Recall this diagram of iterating over different ML ideas. Which of the statements below are true? (Check all that apply.)**
<img width="285" alt="Screenshot 2021-05-16 at 17 05 30" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38349049/118402213-3ad83000-b669-11eb-8487-6430630497d6.png"><br>
- It is faster to train on a big dataset than a small dataset. 
- Recent progress in deep learning algorithms has allowed us to train good models faster (even without changing the CPU/GPU hardware). 
- <span style="color:#99e9fa"><b> Faster computation can help speed up how long a team takes to iterate to a good idea. </b></span>
- <span style="color:#99e9fa"><b> Being able to try out ideas quickly allows deep learning engineers to iterate more quickly. </b></span>

###**4. When an experienced deep learning engineer works on a new problem, they can usually use insight from previous problems to train a good model on the first try, without needing to iterate multiple times through different models. True/False?**
- True
- <span style="color:#99e9fa"><b> False </span></b> 

###**5. Which one of these plots represents a ReLU activation function?** <br>
<img width="245" alt="Screenshot 2021-05-16 at 17 11 00" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38349049/118402320-b508b480-b669-11eb-879e-952cb783b961.png"><br>
- <span style="color:#99e9fa"><b> Figure 3 </span></b> 

###**6. Images for cat recognition is an example of “structured” data, because it is represented as a structured array in a computer. True/False?**
- True
- <span style="color:#99e9fa"><b> False </span></b> 

### 7. A demographic dataset with statistics on different cities' population, GDP per capita, economic growth is an example of “unstructured” data because it contains data coming from different sources. True/False?
- True
- <span style="color:#99e9fa"><b> False </span></b> 

### 8. Why is an RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) used for machine translation, say translating English to French? (Check all that apply.)
- RNNs represent the recurrent process of Idea->Code->Experiment->Idea->....
-  <span style="color:green"><b>It can be trained as a supervised learning problem.</span></b>
- :white_check_mark: <span style="color:#99e9fa"><b>It is applicable when the input/output is a sequence (e.g., a sequence of words).</span></b>
- It is strictly more powerful than a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

### 9. In this diagram which we hand-drew in lecture, what do the horizontal axis (x-axis) and vertical axis (y-axis) represent? 
<img width="551" alt="Screenshot 2021-05-16 at 20 23 20" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38349049/118408171-995ed780-b684-11eb-904e-9f4e4f92d3a9.png"><br>
- <span style="color:#99e9fa"><b>x-axis is the amount of data</span></b>
- <span style="color:#99e9fa"><b>y-axis (vertical axis) is the performance of the algorithm.</span></b>

### 10. Assuming the trends described in the previous question's figure are accurate (and hoping you got the axis labels right), which of the following are true? (Check all that apply.)
- Decreasing the training set size generally does not hurt an algorithm’s performance, and it may help significantly.
- <span style="color:#99e9fa"><b>Increasing the size of a neural network generally does not hurt an algorithm’s performance, and it may help significantly.</span></b>
