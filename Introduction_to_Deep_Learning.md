**1. What does the analogy “AI is the new electricity” refer to?**
[ ] AI is powering personal devices in our homes and offices, similar to electricity.
[ ]Through the “smart grid”, AI is delivering a new wave of electricity.
[X] <b>Similar to electricity starting about 100 years ago, AI is transforming multiple industries.</b>
[ ]AI runs on computers and is thus powered by electricity, but it is letting computers do things not possible before. 
  
**2.Which of these are reasons for Deep Learning recently taking off? (Check the three options that apply.)**
[ ] Neural Networks are a brand new field. 
[X] We have access to a lot more data.
[X] We have access to a lot more computational power. 
[X] Deep learning has resulted in significant improvements in important applications such as online advertising, speech recognition, and image recognition. 

**3.Recall this diagram of iterating over different ML ideas. Which of the statements below are true? (Check all that apply.)**
[ ] It is faster to train on a big dataset than a small dataset. 
[ ] Recent progress in deep learning algorithms has allowed us to train good models faster (even without changing the CPU/GPU hardware). 
[X] Faster computation can help speed up how long a team takes to iterate to a good idea. 
[X] Being able to try out ideas quickly allows deep learning engineers to iterate more quickly. 

**4. When an experienced deep learning engineer works on a new problem, they can usually use insight from previous problems to train a good model on the first try, without needing to iterate multiple times through different models. True/False?**
[ ] True
[X] False

**5. Which one of these plots represents a ReLU activation function?**
